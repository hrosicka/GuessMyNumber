# Getting Started with Go: Build a Number Guessing Game!

Welcome to this tutorial that will guide you through the basics of the Go programming language by creating a simple number guessing game.
Go is a modern, compiled programming language designed at Google.
It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming.

## What will you learn?

During this tutorial, you will become familiar with the following Go language concepts:

* Basic structure of a Go program (`package main`, `import`, `func main`).
* Importing packages (`fmt`, `math/rand`, `os`, `strconv`, `strings`, `time`).
* Working with variables and data types (especially `int` and `string`).
* Input and output using the `fmt` package.
* Reading user input using the `bufio` and `os` packages.
* Converting strings to numbers using the `strconv` package.
* Using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
* Using loops (`for`).
* Generating random numbers using the `math/rand` package.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you don't need any prior knowledge of Go.
You should have Go installed on your computer.
If you don't have it yet, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).

After installation, verify that Go is working by opening your terminal and running the command:

```bash
go version
```

This should print the installed Go version.

### Installing the Go Extension in VS Code

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Click on the square icon on the left sidebar (Extensions).
3.  In the search bar, type "Go".
4.  Find the extension named "Go" by "Go Team at Google" and click the "Install" button.

After installing this extension, developing in Go within VS Code will be much more convenient.
